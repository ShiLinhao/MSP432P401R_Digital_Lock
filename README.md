# MSP432P401R_Digital_Lock

This is a Project of MSP432p401r IN TI CCS6.2 Environment.

I made a 6-digit Digital Lock Simulation which could get input keys from a 4 * 4 Swtich Keybord and Show the STATE of Digital Lock on a OLED screen.

The digital lock has an initial Password '1 1 1 1 1 1'.

The password can be reset if you have had the former one checked.

You can delete the input password one by one if you pressed it wrong.

The MSP432P401R board would blink different kind of colors(Green, Red, Blue) when you unlock the Digital Lock, Fail to do so, or Successfully Reset the password.
